            Anyone and everyone! <b>The group is geared towards providing a safe and fun atmosphere for LGBTQ+ adults and allies.</b> All genders, backgrounds, ages (typically 18+ is encouraged), and athletic abilities are welcome to come give it a try. 
            <br />
            We’ll do our best to pair you up with others around your skill level; we've had members who have played high school, university, college, professional and national level volleyball, and people who have never touched a volleyball before. Most people are somewhere in between.
            <br />
            Free clinics are offered on most weekends for new players who want to learn how to play the game.

This is a public beach, so please do your best to familiarize yourself with and follow the rules of the beach so that we keep our good reputation with all beach goers. 
            <br />
            There is paid parking available at the park, and lots of places to lock up bikes. The Lakeshore bike path will take you right there!

        <p className='mt-2'>
            There is no set schedule, but we try to go out most weekends when the sun is shining (depending on the weather forecast and court availability). An update is posted here for members at the beginning of the week letting everyone know which days we’ll likely be able to play.
            <br />
            Games are all drop-in, so come when you can, play as many games as you'd like, and leave when you need to.
